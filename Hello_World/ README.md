# Overview

This is a simple Hello world program that also shows off the the restart() function.

Hello World programs are usually quite simple so I wanted to show off my restart() function that I developed to add to most of the programs that I make. Its purpose is to continue a program until the user is done using it so the user only has to run the program once to test it.
